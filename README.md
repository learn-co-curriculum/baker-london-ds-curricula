# baker-london-ds-curricula

This repo serves as a general outline for the 2nd London Data Science cohort.
In this repo, we'll find ...

* Scheduling
* Lessons 
* Lesson Goals

## Personal Thoughts

* Squish ML and Data with NLP and Deep as two week tour-de-force?
* Allows for more time wiith basics
* Also acknowledge type of work students want to do??

## Module 1

### Goals

* [ ] Be able to set up a Data Science environment 
* [ ] Feel comfortable using git and Github to collaborate as part of a larger team
* [ ] Perform basic import and export of data with Python
* [ ] Perform basic statistical analyses with Python
* [ ] Use Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
* [ ] Be able to perform basic data cleaning with Pandas
* [ ] Visualize datasets in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn 
* [ ] Run and interpret Linear Regression
* [ ] Communicate Findings in Technical Notebook and Non-Technical Presentation 
 
### Schedule 

The following reflects general lessons to be covered that day and where to find these materials.

### Pre-Work Checklist 

* Coaches know how feelings work 
* Check coaches know how attendence, apt-attitude, personal empowerment, establishing culture
* Get to know coaches strenghts and weaknesses

#### Day 1
 
* Campus Tour and Orientation
	- Lead Provides Call to Action and tips for doing well 
* Technical Set Up 
	- Coaches ensure all students have environment ready to go
	- Also ensure they read ALL of README (esp learn-co) 
	- Check git, gitrepo, and ssh linking 
* Terminal 
	- How to navigate terminal 
	- Vi and nano 
	- Code along 
	- Establish cohort git repo and how to pull
	- Example of how we can compare, make own directory for editing
	- Own Labs (will show how to batch download) 

! Find Materials 

#### Day 2

* Python Fundamentals I 
	- Ensure that need to know nuts and bolts of python 
	- Will return to multiple times
* Decide which Coach will do blog intro and which will do code along 

#### Day 3

* Python Fundamentals II 

* Introduction to Blogs 
	- Should be Coach A, Coach B does code along
	- Introduction Blog (why DS) 
	- Four technical topics later on
	- Need to communicate in non-technical language
	- Timed presentations
	- Make medium account, could be others

#### Day 4

* Libraries, Numpy, Python as Calculator 
	- Ensure not going to be writing lots of for loops
	- Number one rule is to not re-invent the wheel
	- Try to be lazy and effecient 
	- Idea with NP is that it's faster
	- Install software with pip 
	- Can do math operations, fast, with NP 
* Pandas Lecture I 
	- Loading in Data
	- Indexing and why it's important 

#### Day 5

* Pandas II
	- Loc and Iloc lecture...
	- Narrative as to why 
	- Make sure to do lots of review
* Coach Code Along
	- First time for Coach to run preliminary anlayses
	- More important to get across critical thinking
	- Ask why and what can we then learn from doing descriptive stats
* Feelings
	- Start with Coach (remember to set example with professional and personal) 
	- Lead is last (reflect, support, talk about what is going forward) 

#### Day 6

* Pandas III 

#### Day 7

* Best Practices (Keep Short)
* Data Visualizations with matplot lib 
* Blogs I 

#### Day 8

* Linear Regression 101  (Math slides)
* Linear Regression 103 (Variance, Covariance, Correlation) 
* Blogs II 
* Introduce Mod Project and Partners 

#### Day 9

* Blogs III 
* Seaborn 
* Linear Regression 103 (Running in Python and Assumptions, Intrepreting)

#### Day 10

* Example Presentation for Blog (Cohort I) 
* Emphasis on Planning 
* Most of Day for Work 

#### Day 11 

* Project Work and Support 

#### Day 12 

* Project Work and Support 
* Project Dry Run 

#### Day 13 

* Project Final Presentations
